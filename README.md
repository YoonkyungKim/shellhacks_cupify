## Cupify: A guide to educate new merchants on e-commerce, in a fun and interactive way

- Check out our [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/cupify)!

Cupify aims to educate new merchants on e-commerce, in a fun and interactive way. The user will be exposed to key elements of e-commerce throughout the game, such as packaging, accounting, and shipping. Throughout the multiple rounds, the user will leverage these three aspects of e-commerce and hopefully become a super seller (of cute cups in this case)!

It is built with React and Redux and deployed it using Netlify. It is still being implemented, but you can try the game [here](https://cupify.netlify.app/)!
